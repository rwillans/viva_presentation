## Overview

-   **Aim:** To quantify the size of, and limits to, scale and scope economies in English hospital healthcare

-   Data taken from NHS National Cost Collection exercise, augmented by financial statement info and HR systems

-   Parametric methods used

::: notes
This PhD thesis investigated scale and scope economies in English secondary healthcare provision, contributing updated estimates for secondary healthcare using data from a country that has yet to have a successful attempt to measure scale economies.

I use data from the English NHS. Due to its integrated system, a lot of data is available in the UK. This system means that as well as activity information, I could use wage and other input prices, which are not often available in other studies.

In each constituent paper, I use parametric methods to estimate a cost function, deriving scale economy estimates, excepting chapter 5, which is a brief look at scope economies. Various functional forms and parametric methods are used, with results contrasted with each other and their implications discussed.

## Ch 1: Theoretical Background, Data and Estimation

-   Dealing with heterogeneity and multiproduct cost functions

-   Measurement of outputs

-   How do we measure size?

-   Parametric vs Non-Parametric Methods

::: notes
Chapter one outlines the theoretical background and methodological issues.

When considering hospital cost functions, one of the difficulties lies in the heterogeneity of healthcare goods. Hospitals differ from firms producing one or a handful of similar goods, offering an extensive range of specialist health services.

The need to consider heterogeneous outputs means that we must reduce these outputs to a manageable number and deal with them via a multiproduct cost function. Consequently, our definitions of how cost and size are related need to account for this, which is discussed in the chapter, setting out the definition of scale and scope economies used later in the thesis.

The chapter also discusses measurement issues, including how we define and weight hospital outputs, deal with non-healthcare outputs like research and teaching activities, and measure hospital size.

Finally, I briefly discuss my choice of parametric measures and the non-parametric alternative, methodological choices of short or long-run cost functions, and the different functional forms used in cost function estimations.

## Ch 2: Scale Economies - L-R Translog

::: r-fit-text
-   @azevedoCostEffectsHospital2014 +ve scale economies up to 230 beds (Portuguese data),
-   @frechResolvingImpasseHospital1995 +ve up to 370 beds (US Data)
-   @wilsonNonparametricAnalysisReturns2004 no observable limit up to 400 beds (US Data - Non-Parametric Approach)
-   @scottInvestigatingHospitalEfficiency1995 did not conclude due to poor data quality (UK - Scotland)

UK Data available now is richer and inclusive of input price data

Chapter Two is the first analysis chapter proper and estimates scale economies via a long-run translog cost function.

Most recently, direct estimation of the limits to scale economies has been carried out by Azvedo and Mateus, using Portuguese data, and Frech and Wilson using US Data. Both find relatively small limits as their sample consisted of smaller hospitals.

As mentioned before, most literature is dated and not for the UK. Scott et al. tried with Scottish data but were unsatisfied with their estimated function and the data available at the time. That was almost 30 years ago, and data has since improved.

This chapter uses more recent and comprehensive data to estimate scale economies, via a long run translog cost function. The main result is finding small but positive economies of scale, up to approximately 1,200 beds.

Also notable is that scale economies were lower in London and SE. In hindsight, this makes intuitive sense, as proportionate output increases cost more than other areas due to higher wages and a higher price level for non-pay expenditure.

## Ch 3: Scale Economies - L-R Quadratic

::: r-fit-text
-   A shorter chapter which contrasts results using a L-R Quadratic Cost Function.

-   Results are similar but without the same relationship to size

-   The quadratic form has slightly more violations of theoretical principles

    -   More observations where increases in prices or output cause decreases in cost
    -   Also some previous work suggesting a quadratic approach more vulnerable to erroneous results [@vitalianoEstimationHospitalCost1987]

::: notes
Chapter three repeats a similar analysis to the preceding chapter. However, this time the analysis uses a multiproduct quadratic cost function, which has a similar structure to the translog but without logged terms. The quadratic function is less prevalent in the literature but has the advantage that it can model zero outputs as terms are not logged.

With the quadratic function, we obtain a similar range of scale economies to the translog, albeit with much wider confidence intervals. However, the relationship with size is different -- there is less of a clear relationship, and consequently, no observed limit to scale economies. 

When evaluating the properties of the quadratic, it fits the desired theoretical slightly fewer departures from convexity wrt to input prices, so I have preferred the translog. However, the takeaway point is that what best fits the data here may differ from other datasets. Other researchers should consider using both specifications when embarking on studies of this kind.

## Ch 4: Scale Economies - S-R Function

::: r-fit-text
This chapter addresses a critique in the literature arguing against directly using a long-run cost function

-   Using observed values assumes current output is cost-minimising, capital optimal for current output
-   Better to estimate a short-run cost function and then solve for optimal capital [@aletrasComparisonHospitalScale1999]
-   More recent studies [@preyraScaleScopeEfficiencies2006; @kristensenEconomiesScaleScope2012] use this approach and find higher scale economies overall and extended limits
-   Results suggest similar for translog - larger scale economies w/out limit. **But** quadratic returned dubious 'optimal' bed results. Method may overstate scale economies

Chapter four addresses a critique in the literature against directly estimating long-run cost functions. The argument is that by estimating a cost function from observed data, we are in danger of overstating costs at each output level. The overstatement could arise where hospitals have non-optimal levels of capital for their current output level.

To deal with this critique, the suggestion is to first estimate a short-run cost function, derive optimal capital levels, and substituted these back into the short-term function to obtain an optimal long-run function. The results from this approach using a translog are perhaps as expected. The cost-efficient optimal number of beds was slightly lower than the observed values, suggesting that trusts were overcapitalised. When optimal capital values were assumed, economies of scale rose, particularly at the upper end, so no limit was observed.

However, the optimal capital calculation did not return sensible values in the case of the quadratic, which fed through to questionable scale economy results. This finding suggests that this method's results are sensitive to the functional form. The method also does not allow for the requirement for surplus capacity to deal with fluctuating demand. Consequently, I feel this method, aiming to correct one shortcoming, introduces alternate biases that may mean that scale economies are overstated and vulnerable to inappropriate optimal capital calculations.

## Ch 5: Scope Economies

::: r-fit-text
-   Underresearched area - Most studies treat scope as a small extension of a scale study, using the same care setting outputs
-   But, aggregating outputs by specialty grouping makes more sense from the policy viewpoint
-   Studies using translog forced to use limited cost complementarity test -  ${\partial C(y,w)}/{\partial Y_i \partial Y_j} < 0$
-   Quadratic form allows testing separate production vs joint production - $C(y_1, y_2, w) < C(0, y_2, w) + C(y_1, 0, w)$
-   Results show that general surgery has most scope economies compared to other specialty groups, with general medicine and obs/gynae also usually +ve

::: notes
Chapter five deals with economies of scope. Few studies look at this area. Where they do, it is usually considered an extension of a scale economy study, using the same output classifications as the scale economies study. However, this is not useful from a policy point of view, as decisions on collocation are structured around clinical specialities. Consequently, I regroup outputs based on specialty rather than care setting.

I also use a quadratic form in this chapter. Studies using the more popular translog form are forced to use a limited test for scope economies based on cost complementarities or negative coefficients on interaction terms. This test is weak because it only detects positive spillover effects from variable costs, not from sharing fixed costs. Fixed cost sharing might be an important source of scope economies where things like maintaining hospital buildings and equipment are significant.

Results show that generalist specialties, particularly general surgery, have larger economies of scope with all other activities. General Surgery, General Medicine, and to a lesser extent, obstetrics and gynaecology had positive scope economies, whilst orthopaedics and diagnostic activity had none or negative scope economies.

## Conclusion and Contributions

::: r-fit-text
### Research Contributions

-   Can update prior estimates of scale economies and their limits 
-   Variations observed between translog and quadratic forms, especially where fewer data points
-   Can add in prices to cost function, rather than assuming national procurement / wage structures -\> no variation

### Policy Implications

-   Expansion of smaller hospitals may yield small financial benefits compared to expansion of larger organisations
-   Variation in scale economies between high and low cost areas
-   General Surgery, and to a lesser extent General Medicine & Obs/Gynae, ought to be colocated with other specialties
:::

::: notes

The conclusion chapter argues that, as a result of this thesis, we can update estimates from old studies, suggesting that technology has moved on. There is no evidence that diseconomies of scale now apply before at least 1,200 beds, possibly further dependent on the particular method used.

It also shows some evidence for divergence in results between quadratic and translog functional forms. Future studies may wish to use both forms for robustness.

Previous studies often relied on national-level procurement and wage setting and did not include input prices. This study includes input prices where possible and can consequently demonstrate a difference between high and low-cost areas. 

In policy terms, there may be small benefits from increasing output amongst smaller hospitals, at least up to 1,200 beds. These savings are unlikely to justify full mergers but should be considered when planning care supply. Policymakers also may wish to consider that scale economies will be lower in higher cost areas around London, and plan accordingly. 

Finally, policymakers ought to consider the effects of scope. This thesis only lightly touches on scope economies. However, it shows some evidence that 'generalist' specialities, and general surgery in particular, benefit from collocation with other activities. A base level of those services should be supplied in each hospital. 

That concludes my brief overview -- will pause here for questions and discussion.
